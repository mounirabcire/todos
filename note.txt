- React core component are strict, each compo has to handle it's logic
    for example, we cannot write text inside the View compo otherwise an error will occur

- View by default uses Flexbox to orgnize its children structure

- in RN styling we only use either % or number (px)

- the styling inheritance from parent to child is not part of RN, (no cascading)

- each of these core component has props that work for both IOS and Android or one of them.

- The FlatList is self closing compo that only render the needed list, it accespts the data, renderItem props and auto will generate a meta object data with our data and a unique key
    for each list, if our single aray data are not primitve are object taht contain the key prop, otherwise we use the keyExtractro prop



- Learned RN core compo: view, text, textInput, button, scrollView, FlatList, Pressable(andoir_ripple & style for IOS), Modal
