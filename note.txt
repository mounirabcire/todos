- React core component are strict, each compo has to handle it's logic
    for example, we cannot write text inside the View compo otherwise an error will occur

- View by default uses Flexbox to orgnize its children structure

- in RN styling we only use either % or number (px)

- the styling inheritance from parent to child is not part of RN, (no cascading)

- Learned RN core compo: view, text, textInput, button, scrollView
